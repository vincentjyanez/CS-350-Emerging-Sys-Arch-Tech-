Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Project: 3-2 Milestone Two Submission

Overview
This project involved programming the TI CC3220x LAUNCHXL using Code Composer Studio (CCS)
to control an LED via a state machine and UART communication.

Key Tasks:

LED Control: Turn the LED ON/OFF using a state machine and GPIO, and demonstrate it in a video.
UART Communication: Read single characters from the UART, encode them, and send them back.
State Machine: Implement and document a state machine to control the LED.
Documentation: Create a state machine diagram (draw.io) and save it as a PDF.

What did you do particularly well?

I successfully demonstrated the project by creating a clear video showing the LEDs blinking on the board. 
The video highlighted how the state machine controlled the LED, turning it ON and OFF based on the user's 
input ("ON" or "OFF") through the console.

Where could you improve?

I could improve by better understanding how to zip files properly to avoid issues when submitting projects. 
Additionally, I sometimes struggle to get the code to work as expected, which leads to running it repeatedly 
to troubleshoot. To improve, I could focus on debugging techniques and understanding error messages to identify 
problems more efficiently. Lastly, I could spend more time planning and reviewing my code before running it to 
minimize errors and save time.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I am adding debugging tools in Code Composer Studio to help identify and fix issues more efficiently. Additionally,
I am using online resources like forums and documentation for troubleshooting code and understanding embedded system
concepts better. Iâ€™m also planning to use tutorials and guides for more practice with zipping files and improving my
project management skills.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The skills gained from this project, such as working with embedded systems, using UART for communication, and 
controlling hardware like LEDs via a state machine, will be highly transferable. Understanding debugging techniques, 
memory management (using limited RAM), and working with Code Composer Studio will also be valuable in future projects. 
Additionally, the experience with writing clear documentation, using state machines, and applying coding best practices 
will help in other coursework, especially in programming, hardware design, and systems engineering projects.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made the project maintainable and readable by using clear variable names and adding comments to explain the code. 
I also kept the code organized into smaller, easy-to-understand functions. To make it adaptable, I used simple and 
modular code that can be easily changed or expanded in the future. This helps with debugging and makes it easier to 
update the project later.
